# PalmtopTiger

Danmaku/Bullet hell inspired game made as a quick project for a coding class.

Shamelessly uses the incredible music from Phantasmagoria of Flower View, full credits to ZUN.

If you have any suggestions/better ways to make stuff work, please do say so.

If you do use the art/code, crediting me would be really appreciated.
